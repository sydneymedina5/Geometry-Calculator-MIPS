This is a geometry calculator coded in MIPS, it has the following functions for INTEGER coordinates given by the user.

1. Dot Product of two three-dimensional coordinates
2. Cross Product of two three-dimensional coordinates
3. Area of multiple coordinates in clockwise or counter clockwise form
4. Volume of a cube or rectangular prism

These are the functions that my program can compute
